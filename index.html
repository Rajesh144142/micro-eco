        <div class="answer">
            <p>Microeconomics is the 
                study of what is likely 
                to happen (tendencies) when individuals make choices in response to changes in incentives, prices, resources, and/or methods of production. Individual actors are often grouped into microeconomic subgroups,
             such as buyers, sellers,
              and business owners.
              The word microeconomics derives from the Greek word 'mikros'(small, minor). Microeconomic study historically has been performed according to general equilibrium theory, developed by LÃ©on Walras in Elements of Pure Economics (1874) and partial equilibrium theory, introduced by Alfred Marshall in Principles of Economics (1890).
